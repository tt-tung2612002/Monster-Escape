# Dino_in_Zungle
Hello everyone,
My name is Thai and this is my first game project using SDL2 and C++. It is a simple endless-running game, based on Google Chrome Dinosaur.
This might have many mistakes, but I hope you can enjoy it! Just press UP arrow to jump and dodge the obstacles!
That's it! Have fun!
